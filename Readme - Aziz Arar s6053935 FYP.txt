Aziz Arar s6053935 FYP Readme

My Artefact is located in the folder "Aziz Arar s6053935 FYP - Tilemap Procedural Generation"

I have included Unity 2018.2.15f1 with my submission, as it is the version of Unity I developed the Project with.

Inside the Artefact contains 3 Demos which Generate a Topdown World Map, a Topdown Dungeon and a Sidescrolling Level with the tiles already setup.

To generate a new level in a fresh scene, press "Aziz" located in the Menu Bar, then the dropdown "Tilemap Generator".

A demo character is included to test the collisions in the levels, but can spawn within a collider, It may need to be moved when a level is generated.

Tiles must then be selected to generate a level, once the Tiles have been selected, press "Generate" and play the scene.

The levels are generated when Play is pressed.
